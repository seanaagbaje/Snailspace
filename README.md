# Card Game Project: Snailspace-Inspired

## Overview

This repository features a personal card game project inspired by the game **Snailspace**, which is described in *Original Card Games* by David Parlett. The game concept is adapted for personal use and is not intended for publication or distribution.

## Important Notice

## Game Description

### Snailspace

- **Players:** 2 (Human vs. Human or Player vs. Computer)
- **Cards:** 52
- **Type:** Positional

#### Objective

To add cards to a 5x5 grid in a spiral direction to form and score combinations similar to those in Cribbage, including:
- Pairs
- Prials (Three of a kind)
- Double Pair Royals (Four of a kind)
- Sequences (Runs) of three or more
- Flushes of three or more (with some restrictions)

#### Setup

1. Deal 25 cards face down to create a 5x5 grid, placing the next card face up at the center.
2. Deal 13 cards to each player.

#### Play

1. Each player, starting with the non-dealer, plays a card face up in a spiral order:
   - First card goes to the right of the starter.
   - Next card below, next to the left, and so on, completing the spiral to the top right.
   - Each player will have one card left at the end of their turn to choose from.

#### Scoring

Score points based on combinations made in the row or column of the played card:
- **Pair:** 2 points
- **Prial:** 6 points
- **Double Pair Royal:** 12 points
- **Run (Sequence) of three:** 3 points
- **Run of four:** 4 points
- **Run of five:** 5 points
- **Flush of three:** 3 points
- **Flush of four:** 4 points
- **Flush of five:** 5 points

Note: In runs, Ace counts as low (1). Flushes require all cards to be touching without interruption by cards of different suits.

#### Example

Hereâ€™s a sample play:

- **Annie:** diamondJ = pair (2), spade8 = 0, heartJ = prial (6), etc.
- **Benny:** heart10 = 0, club9 = run of 3, spade10 = run of 3, etc.

Total Scores:
- **Annie:** 27
- **Benny:** 43

### Variant

Instead of scoring as you go, complete the spiral and then:
- Dealer scores each of the five columns (verticals) as separate Cribbage hands.
- Non-dealer scores each of the five rows (horizontals) similarly.

## Player vs. Computer Version

In addition to the traditional human vs. human gameplay, a **Player vs. Computer** version of the game has been created. The computer opponent uses a basic AI to simulate play and provide a challenging experience. This version allows single-player mode and can be useful for practice or solo enjoyment.

## Installation
